Use a logarithmic amplifier. Put a diode in feedback with an op-amp and it does that for you

2 LEDs: 660nm(red) and 940nm(infrared) typical
LEDs flash at 30Hz
LUT to convert Oxygenated:deoxygenated haemoglobin ratio

How it works, with diagrams: http://www.howequipmentworks.com/physics/respi_measurements/oxygen/oximeter/pulse_oximeter.html

Will need a variable amp to change the the amplification for it to work properly. Else do it digitally?

Start by getting a basic pulse meter working first!
